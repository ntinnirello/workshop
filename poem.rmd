## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
“You are sad,” the Knight said in an anxious tone: “Let me sing you a song to comfort you.”

“Is it very long?” Alice asked, for she had heard a good deal of poetry that day.

“It's long,” said the Knight, “but it's very, very beautiful. Everybody that hears me sing it - either it brings the tears to their eyes, or else -”

“Or else what?” said Alice, for the Knight had made a sudden pause.

“Or else it doesn't, you know. The name of the song is called ‘Haddocks' Eyes.’
## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
ONCE when the snow of the year was beginning to fall,	  
We stopped by a mountain pasture to say, “Whose colt?”  	
A little Morgan had one forefoot on the wall,	  
The other curled at his breast. He dipped his head	  
And snorted to us. And then we saw him bolt.	   
## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
